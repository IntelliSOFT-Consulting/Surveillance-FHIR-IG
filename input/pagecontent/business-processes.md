# Business Processes & Workflows

A business process is a set of related activities or tasks performed together to achieve the objectives of the health programme area, such as registration, counselling, referrals. Workflows are a visual representation of the progression of activities (tasks, events, interactions) that are performed within the business process. The workflow provides a “story” for the business process being diagrammed and is used to enhance communication and collaboration among users, stakeholders and engineers.

This DAK focuses on key business processes conducted by the personas (described in Component 2) as part of disease surveillance and response service provision. These business processes are described in table below. For each of these business processes, the corresponding business processes, data elements and decision-support needs are detailed within the following sections of this document.

            The pool assumes process control – in other words, it assigns the tasks. A pool consists of one or more “swim lanes” that depict all the individuals or types of users that are involved in carrying out the business process or workflow. Diagrams should be clear, neat and easy for all viewers to understand the relationships across the different swim lanes. For example, a pool would depict the business process of conducting an outreach activity, which involves multiple stakeholders represented by different lanes in that pool. <br>
            A business process diagram can contain two or more pools that connect through message flows (messages received from outside of the pool). This indicates different process owners collaborating and exchanging information.
            For example, in the case of a referral, the health facility “A” (the referring facility) represents the process owner that assigns internally the tasks for the actors represented as swim lanes in the pool.  The health facility “B” (the receiving facility) has allocated its own pool and it’s considered a different process owner, with the same role. These 2 facilities exchange information relevant for a referral (client history, referral details, etc.), represented as message flows, but each facility has control only over the internal activities, without directly impacting the activities of the other facility.

### Overview of IDSR Processes
<div class="text-center">
<img title="Event Based Surveillance" alt="Event Based Surveillance" src="/input/images/event_based_surveillance.png"/>
<br>
<p><strong>Signal triage</strong> is the process of sorting out (filtering) reported signals to identify which ones are mostly likely to be real events.</p>
<p> Guiding triage questions: <br>
1. Does the reported information match any pre-defined EBS signal? <br>
2. Is the information relevant for EWAR? (Is it on-going?) <br>
3. Has the signal not been reported previously (Not a duplicate)? <br>
Any signal that gets a “YES” response to all the three questions is subjected to verification <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Risk Assessment</strong> is the process of determining the level of risk of an event poses to public health and recommending the appropriate level response needed</p>
<p>Tools such as risk characterization matrix can be used to guide decision making.</p>

#### Reporting and data use business process notes and annotations
<p><strong> General Notes </strong></p>
<p>Digital, case-based surveillance systems have several advantages compared with the more traditional paper-based aggregated systems, such as reductions in the recording and reporting workload of frontline workers, better data quality, faster access to data at all levels, more flexible data analysis and enhanced use of data through record linkage between databases. For this reason, WHO encourages countries to make the transition from paper-based aggregated to case-based digital surveillance.</p>

1. **Check data quality**
   - Health-care facility data are reviewed for accuracy, validity and completeness.
   - This can be supported through automated checks in a digital system.

2. **Were data quality issues found?**

3. **Correct fixable data quality issues**
   - Where possible, inaccurate, invalid or incomplete data should be checked against source records and corrected according to the national standard operating procedures.
   - Depending on local policy, this step might need to be delegated to a person with the appropriate data access rights.

4. **Generate aggregate reports**
   - The health worker generates aggregate reports of predefined indicators aligned with national monitoring and evaluation guidelines.
   - This can be automated and done digitally.

5. **Check the aggregate reports**
   - Check for any potential remaining data quality issues such as implausible values or outputs.

6. **Were issues found in the reports?**
   - If so, return to step 3.

7. **Analyse and interpret the reports**
   - The analyses and interpretation of the reports should identify opportunities to improve the performance of the health-care facility, such as tracing missing data or contacting patients who have not attended a clinic.
   - Data analysis and interpretation can be done regularly and should not be limited to the reporting schedule.

8. **Take actions based on the findings**
   - Findings from the reports can inform corrective actions.

9. **Submit data electronically**
   - This can be automated and done digitally.
   - Depending on the local policies and system design, an active “submission” may not be needed and the district-level, provincial-level and national-level ministry of health should be able to access data directly for reporting purposes.

10. **Reveiw the submitted data**
    - The sub county health office reviews the quality of the submitted data.

11. **Provide feedback to th facility**
    - The focal person at the district level will provide feedback to the facility. If data quality issues are identified, the facility may be required to restart the process and resubmit the reports.
