# Decision Support Logic

The decision-support logic component of the DAK provides the decision logics and algorithms, in accordance with [L1] guidelines. In this DAK, the decision logics and algorithms deconstruct the recommendations within the IDSR guidelines and guidance into a format that clearly labels the inputs and outputs that would be operationalized in a digital decision-support system.
