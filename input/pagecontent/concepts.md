### Notation Guidance

Throughout this DAK, there are identification (ID) numbers to simplify tracking and referencing of each of the components. Note that the DAK represents an overview across the different components, while the comprehensive and complete outputs of each component (e.g. data dictionary) are included in appended spreadsheets. The notation guide is as follows;

-   **Component 1: Health interventions and associated recommendations**
    -   No notations used

-   **Component 2: Generic personas**
    -   No notations used

-   **Component 3: User scenarios**
    -   No notations used
    
-   **Component 4: Business processes and workflows**
    -   Each workflow should have a “Process name” and a corresponding letter
    -   Each workflow should also have a “Process ID” that should be structured as “Abbreviated health domain” (e.g. IDSR). “Corresponding letter for the process” (e.g. A)
    -   Each activity in the workflow should be numbered with an “Activity ID” that should be structured as “Process ID” from above “Activity Number” e.g.IDSR.A1

-   **Component 5: Data dictionary**
    -   Each data element should have a running number and a “Data Element (DE) ID” that should be structured “Abbreviated health domain” (e.g. IDSR).“DE”. “Sequential number of the data element” (e.g. IDSR.C.DE5, IDSR.C.DE)

-   **Component 6: Decision Support Logic**
    -   Each decision-support logic table should have a running number and a “Decision-support table (DT) ID” that should be structured “Abbreviated health domain” (e.g. IDSR).“DT”. “Sequential number of the decision-support table” (e.g. IDSR.DT.1, IDSR.DT.2).

-   **Component 7: Indicators and Perfomance Metrics**
    -   Each indicator should have an “Indicator ID” that should be structured “Abbreviated health domain” (e.g. IDSR).“IND”. “Sequential number of the indicator”(e.g. IDSR.IND.1, IDSR.IND.2)

-   **Component 8: High Level System Requirements**
    -   Each functional requirement should have a “Functional requirement ID” that should be structured “Abbreviated health domain” (e.g. IDSR).“FXREQ”. “Sequential number of the functional requirement”(e.g. IDSRFXREQ.1, IDSR.FXREQ.1).

    -   Each non-functional requirement should have a “Non-functional requirement ID” that should be structured “Abbreviated health domain” (e.g. IDSR). “NFXNREQ”. “Sequential number of non-functional requirements” (e.g. IDSR.NFXNREQ.1, IDSR. NFXNREQ.2).
