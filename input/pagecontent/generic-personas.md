# Personas

A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end-user, of the system. In this section, the goal is to provide a clear depiction of the end-users, supervisors, and related stakeholders who would be interacting with the digital system or involved in the care pathway.

### Targeted Personas

The targeted personas for this Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) DAK are health workers operating in care settings that are able to provide the required essential interventions for IDSR care delivery. In the case of IDSR, health care providers at the health facilities are the primary personas for the digital client health record and decision-support systems. The key competences of various actors in the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response are defined as follows

### Related Personas
In addition to the targeted personas detailed above, there may be value in exploring other personas within the context of disease surveillance and response services, such as the patients reporting symptoms, and  community members observing emerging diseases. However, these were not identified as the central personas for the data and decision-support content detailed in this DAK. The related personas are listed below
